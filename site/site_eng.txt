PairFX The free tournament pairing program for school and youth chess tournaments available in Dutch, French and English!

Engels??
PairFX is a pairing program for youth tournaments in schools and chess clubs . It supports the organization of a so-called 'run through' tournament. 
You can add and remove players on the fly and adjust the pairings if you wish. Its not round based but game based, so those who can play faster will be playing more games than those who play slower. That's not bad. 
The pairing algorithm sorts the players according to percentage and points, and then tries from the bottom to the top to make pairings. 
The important thing is that the players play as much as possible. Where round based pairing programs come in handy when organizing club competitions and adults tournaments, PairFX proves to be better for youth tournaments. Ideal to run tournaments at school! Are you a chess teacher at school, or organize a separate tournament at the club? Try PairFx!



How does it work?
Suppose you have 20 players, so 10 games. After 10 minutes, six players have finished playing and are doing nothing.
Instead of keeping themselves busy or disturbing the other games,you can get them to play chess immediately again with PairFX.
Is a chess player tired of playing, you do not need to pair him again. When a new player wants to join late, you just add him and your done.
PairFX takes into account 'color preference' as much as possible, alternating white and black. Furthermore, players can play each other multiple times. But not in the last three rounds (you can adjust this). 

So if the message indicates that a pairing is not possible, then it is one of those reasons. Both parameters can be adjusted in the tournament file if needed. and best of al .. it's completely free !
